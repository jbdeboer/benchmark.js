NOTES

-> benchmark calls 'cycle' multiple times, which fills in the 'times' object in the
->   output.

Where does 'sample' come from?
  -> a cycle may "continue" but calling cycle() again, but that is not the
     end of the cycle...

     When cycle.running != true, benchmark copies samples into the stats object.



-----

v1 shows time on the x and time on the y.

v2:
 -> show ops/sec on the y, time on the x.
 -> max and min.
